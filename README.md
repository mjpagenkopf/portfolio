# Project 1 Week - Portfolio Update

## Description

I added projects that I had created during the weeks between creating my portfolio. These assignments include the Workday Scheduler, the Weather Dashboard App and the first group project, a Covid 19 Data Center Application. Each addition includes a brief description and links to the live websites.
